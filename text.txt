My name is Polly. I am ten. I am a responsible schoolgirl. I go to school.
I like learning English and playing puzzles. 
I would like to tell you about my family. It is neither big nor small. 
There are four of us. I have got a mother. Her name is Jane. She is a teacher. 
She is very responsible and creative. She likes her work. 
Her hobbies are singing and shopping. My mother is fond of reading detective stories. 
I have got a father. His name is Jack. He is a doctor. He is clever and hardworking. 
My father likes playing golf. He goes in for sport to be healthy and strong. 
He is fond of fishing too. My brother Nick is small. He is only four. 
He likes playing toys. 
Usually we get on well with him, but sometimes he is very responsible naughty. 
On Saturdays and Sundays we like to be together. 
Last Sunday we went to the country. We had a good rest.
